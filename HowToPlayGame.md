How to Play the Game

The objective of the game is to sort all balls so that each tube contains balls of only one color. 
You start by entering your name, and the game begins with a shuffled set of colored balls placed inside tubes.
Click on any tube to select it (the tube highlights in yellow), 
then click another tube to move the top ball—provided the destination tube has space.
Every successful move increases your move counter, and the game timer runs continuously until you win.
When all tubes are correctly sorted, your score (winner status, moves, and time) is saved to the leaderboard, 
which ranks players using a min-heap–based sorting system.
